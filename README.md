# insurance
Objective- the main aim of this project is to find whether the claim by the hospitals to the insurance company is fraud or genuine. 
Methods & Algorithms- Naïve Bayes (under sampling) algorithm is used to build the model.

Tools- R

IDE- Rstudio

Brief Description- Insurance data set was considered. Size of data was around 1 million records. We analyse the data and replace the missing values in the data and then did the feature selection to select the important columns for model building. We build the model using Naïve Bayes (under sampling) algorithm. The accuracy of the model was 67.56%. Model was deployed using Rshiny.

Business Benefits- the business benefit of the project is to reduce the fraud claims which are done by the hospitals to the insurance companies.
